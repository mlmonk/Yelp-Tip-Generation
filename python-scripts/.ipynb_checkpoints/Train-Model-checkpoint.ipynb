balanced out the cajun flavor and how the salmon was cooked just right . but the super white was out of this world tender and flavorful . you simply must try that . i must pause to mention that the food came out pretty fast , and we generally found ordering not to be a hassle , except for the hiccup of having waiters switched on us . the special nigiri were pretty good , but they weren t that distinctive except maybe the conch . the standard nigiri were all great , as expected , as were the appetizers and desserts . i also really liked the sashimi salad even though the sashimi pieces were small and the helping of crab modest , but it s still nice . with all the special items , i barely had time for rolls , but i did try one piece of someone s magma roll . it was pretty good but not my favorite due to spiciness . the best part of the night was easily enjoying five orders of pork belly pieces each , and the next best part was having about six orders six pieces of cajun salmon because people were full or just didn t feel like it . in my book , goyemon has the edge over sushi mon mainly because of that pork belly . i could have easily eaten that fat filled , sweet sauce covered goodness all night . thus , this is still the vegas area sushi place that i d recommend for dinner over all others . <end>'],\n",

       "  '<start> . everything was a okay , saave for the pork chop baked rice . . i ve never had a baked rice that expensive before ! it does come with a bowl of soup chinese style or russian borscht done chinese style and a hot drink tea , coffee or lemon water . in the picture , they serve the rice in a large , circular dish . it actually came in a large , circular dish , but that dish is one of those dishes that has the wide brim and a small centre , so the portion was actually not very large . it did come with cheese on top , which i have to give them credit for , but the tomato sauce was next to non existent . for all i know , i could have been eating a baked pork chop atop a bed of egg fried rice . not cool . the crispy beef brisket was as i remember it . crispy on the outside and tender on the inside . at . , it s not particularly expensive , but it s also not cheap . portion was alright . their chiu chow fish noodle is quite good as well . it s fish noodles think slightly thinned out fish paste stir fried in a soy sauce based sauce along with bean sprouts , carrot shreds , small bits of pork and a few small shrimps . at . , this is fairly unique , and i d totally get this again . one small issue i had was that my cup had a black smudge on it . i thought it was a permanent thing until i touched it and it transferred onto my hand . um . . . yeah . not a fan of unidentifiable smudges on or in my body . i won t be back for their baked rices , but i ll probably be back for some other things . this place is quite solid . service was friendly . owner was very friendly , and super chatty . service in english was pretty good too . had starter borscht soup free . each person got a bowl . they were out of chinese soup . that s fine . i like borscht . tomato based , slightly spicy , filled with cabbage , carrots , celery , etc . nice and not watery , just the way i like it . fish noodles chiu chow style . all the noodles in this dish are made of fish paste . these noodles are then stir fried with sprouts , shrimp , slivers of pork , onion , bits of egg , etc . it s savory , but has a hint of sweetness to it . i really enjoy the chew of the noodles . tastes even better with a touch of chili oil one of the condiments provided at each table . pork tripe actually stomach and chicken in hot pot can t remember the price or the actual name of this dish . it s fairly obvious which one it is though . served in a metal wok atop a burner . broth has a nice white pepper taste . pork stomach was not too chewy , but still chewy . that s a good thing , by the way . also came with pieces of corn on the cob and dul pock bean curd skin ? chinese bean curd pockets ? i m having a brain fart right now . this dish really warms the stomach and throat up in a very pleasant way . fried beef brisket with curry sauce the brisket is marinated in five spice and anise and other things , then cut up , battered , and deep fried . it adds a very interesting textural component to an otherwise standard dish . the beef is tender and flavorful . the batter is really crispy . the curry has a nice aroma that i don t expect to find in chinese curries chinese curries have the tendency to disappoint me . the only downside to this dish is that some of the pieces of brisket are really big . bite size would be nice , please . snow pea sprouts with king oyster mushrooms snow pea shoots were fresh . king oyster mushrooms were tender . sauce was well done . my dad and my grandfather were thrilled . red bean sweet soup with sago also free . just sweet enough . i would have preferred cream in mine , but i m not a fan of red bean sweet soup to begin with . this was done a more traditional way than i like . the red beans we were told came from japan . they weren t overcooked , so they still had a bit of a chew . for those of you who are interested in vip discount cards , they have one here . for a year . you get off everything on their regular menu if i m not mistaken . i bought one . total damage for the night after off was and a bit before tips . i ll be back . fish noodles , wait for me ! perhaps i ve been listening to too much k pop . this restaurant is very up and down if anyone gets this reference , let me know . what i mean is that what they do well , they do really well see my previous reviews for their crispy beef brisket and their fish noodles . there are certain dishes , however , where they miss the mark by quite a bit . side note i ve never had a starter soup here i didn t like . thursday s chinese soup was delicious . very sweet naturally sweet . it s a chinese thing . their king oyster mushroom with snow pea shoots . does not disappoint . we ve had it twice now and the portion is big , the veggies are fresh , and it s served piping hot . it s also cheaper than its congee queen equivalent i checked the menu yesterday . my issue this time was that we got their fish belly with tofu in hot pot . , and it wasn t hot enough . typically , if something is served in a hot pot and we re not talking shabu shabu here , but more of a sizzling hot pot , if should come out still bubbling . part of what you pay for when you order something in a hot pot is that it does exactly that sizzle and bubble . otherwise , who cares whether it s in a hot pot or not . if it doesn t sizzle and bubble , then the hot pot is rendered useless . this dish came to our table and it wasn t sizzling . actually , it was not even as hot as the veggie dish i mentioned above , which did not come in a hot pot . as such , essentially , we paid a premium typically , getting a dish in a hot pot costs at least a dollar more than its non hot pot counterpart for a more unique , but ineffective serving dish . ironically , it was set up to be super hot . there was a trivet under the dish above the plate , and the waiter who brought it to our table handed it as if he could burn himself . the fish and the tofu tasted good , but i m cranky about my hot pot . my other reviews still stand . this one is specifically for breakfast . they only serve breakfast and noodles in soup with the exception of braised beef before am , which is when the chef comes in . most of their other menu pages do say that these are not served before am , but there are other pages that do not have time restrictions on them , and i thought these would be available . i was wrong . their breakfast menu is fairly limited . they also have no room for substitutions . i ordered a combo that included luncheon meat with macaroni in soup and condensed milk on toast . . this also came with a drink . i wanted instant noodles instead of macaroni , because i do not like macaroni in soup . i told my parents my order , and went to grab a few groceries . i got back just in time to see them put macaroni in soup down on our table . my parents then told me that they did not do substitutions . they couldn t just upcharge me for the noodles ? i mean , they have instant noodles with other available menu items . taste wise , the luncheon meat and macaroni in soup was exactly what i expected . i ended up adding chili oil and ketchup . the condensed milk on toast was a bit of a shocker . i m a sucker for condensed milk on toast . i m also accustomed to getting two slices of bread when i order this at other places . this is a sandwich . today , it was once slice of toast with a a small amount of condensed milk drizzled on . it was also served open faced , but cut in half . i ended up making my own sandwich out of the two halves . the two middle bites did taste like condensed milk on toast , but the rest of it just tasted mostly like bread . disappointing . oh . the macaroni in soup was small too . four of us were at breakfast . we ended up ordering two meals . we received one spoon , one fork , one knife , and two napkins . we asked for bowls , and we were given one bowl . we then asked for another one . my macaroni meal came first . that one came with just a spoon yeah . our spoon , fork , and knife were for two different meals . i can eat my macaroni and my luncheon meat with a spoon , but that s when i m being lazy at home and i don t want to wash extra cutlery . if i m at a restaurant and especially if i m expected to pay tips , i would hope i get more than just a spoon to eat luncheon meat with . mindblown . oh . right . we have a vip card . we paid for it a while back . it gets us off . apparently , breakfast does not count in this . not cool . i will do what i can to avoid breakfast here , especially if it s close to am . i d rather wait for another restaurant to open . aside thing that happened . i do not blame the restaurant for this . there was a couple at the table next to us . the man had sausage , eggs , and hash browns . he was cutting his sausage , and a piece shot off and landed in my personal bubble . actually in my personal bubble . it was on the floor about two inches away from my jacket . um . . . yeah . <end>'],\n",

       "  '<start> the recent elite event at verde reminded me , i m definitely in need of a re review of this place ! since our first encounter , i have taken my own advice several times and come here , treating it as a bar more than a restaurant , reveling in a variety of tequilas , and cocktails involving it . they bring around your first round of chips for free if you re at a table , and they re unlimited at the bar . along with the chips , their appetizers are usually enough to split between two people over drinks , but they usually have a few items on special so you might want to enjoy a flatbread made with the freshest ingredients they could find that day . being one who enjoys to branch out as much as i can , i love to come in for their agave wednesdays , that is a half oz taste of any tequila on their wall that is usually priced under for only ! so , you can create your own flights of tequila to suit your tastes , or let the bartender know what you like and have them spin up their own . be sure to ask for the ipad menu to get an interactive look at their selection , along with tasting notes and label texts . their patio recently opened , which is a welcome addition to the neighborhood . service has also been greatly improved since the last view now very attentive and friendly , if not still a bit scripted . the bartenders are all wonderful , very well versed in all of the tequilas and in making excellent cocktails . if you re looking to grab a few drinks or get an education in tequila , and get some excellent modern mexican inspired snacks and maybe dinner , but i haven t tried in a while , verde is probably the best place to stop . be sure to heed the warning on the door about parking if you park in the glass lofts lot , there is about a chance of getting towed . also , verde now serves brunch saturdays and sundays , which is delicious ! after many months of waiting for a restaurant to take the space at the bottom of the glass lofts and then many more for it to actually be constructed ! , verde has finally had a soft opening to the public . why soft ? the way i understand it , not of all their alcohol is in yet . regardless , i will review it as such , and take the service into account as little as possible the star rating does not reflect the service , and i will put service related comments in a section at the end . we arrived for our reservations and were seated immediately , the restaurant was just under half full and the bar was just over three quarters full . we were seated at a small two person table i hate those damn things , and given brand spanking new menus . the right hand side of the menu is the beverages or margaritas from , a handful of craft cocktails for , tequilas running the gamut from to for a shot , beers for , and standard mexican n a drinks . i loved this part of the menu because while i don t care much for margaritas , and i m not much for tequila , they do offer several different tasting flights that are fairly affordable . these range in price from about to and offer trios by style or by brand . the tequilas are also served with a shot of sangrita a delicious concoction that goes perfectly with tequila and tastes kind of like a bloody mary but without crappy tabasco flavor . the left hand of the menu offers about appetizers , most involving chips , soups and salads , entrees , and tacos ea . while the appetizers and salads had several veggie options , there were only two entrees and no tacos that fell into the category . regardless , the vegetarian items were marked , so that gets points . my girlfriend ordered a spicy honey bbq margarita , while i opted for the tequila flight one blanco , one reposado , and one anejo . we also got the fried plantains with chipotle aioli as a starter , and i got the chicken mole while she got the mushroom enchiladas . her margarita , while it had a tasty aftertaste , had a bit too much lime for me but i she enjoyed it . my tequila was fairly self explanatory , but i love the concept of the flight . it really lets you enjoy their differences the smells , the tastes , the burns , etc all at once , and allows you a better appreciation for their differences . chips and salsa came first , and they were awesome . not a lot of cilantro in the salsa i hate cilantro and the chips tasted fresh . when the plantains arrived , their presentation was wonderful , placed on a banana leaf , but unfortunately i found that they were too thick to really enjoy . the flavor of the sauce and the cotija was excellent , but it was quickly lost while the thick , starchy plantain persisted . our mains arrived , mine over fries made of yucca and hers with red rice and black beans on the side . i found her rice and beans to be wonderful especially the strong tomato and pepper flavor in the rice , but again my yucca was too thick and starchy to eat even the modest serving that accompanied my dish . my girlfriend said that her enchiladas were excellent as far as flavor goes , but they were fairly small and for only two of them , she felt the value wasn t quite there for a vegetarian dish . my chicken on the other hand was a fairly sizable porton and extremely well cooked my only complaint being that i d love more mole with it . also , being still on the bone made it a bit difficult to eat in this kind of restaurant . the desserts sounded good , but we opted out . our waitress urged us to try the sorbet when we returned . verde is a good option , and nice to see some mexican food in the area that isn t simply burritos . as we exited , the table next to us was served a chili relleno that , if it tasted as good as it looked , could have earned another star easily . sadly , though for the price and the quality , i feel that it would be hard for us to make the decision to walk past salt to eat here . as a bar lounge , i think verde excels , but as a restaurant , i think it falls a bit short . i will gladly return in a few months to give them another chance , though also i d be doing them a disservice if i failed to mention the free wifi and extra outlets in the restaurant . chips , salsa , a drink , and a laptop could turn this place into an excellent spot to work through lunch . service the service was poor , even for an opening night . in the two hours ! it took us to get our food , our waitress only spoke to us about times at no point did they mention the wait , ask us to bear with them , etc . worse though , in start contrast to the image they portray through their social media presence , the service was stiff and as formal as they could try and be it came off as inauthentic in my opinion . again , i won t dwell on the service issues because it was opening night i m sure they ll be ironed out quickly . <end>'],\n",

       "  '<start> i really enjoy becky and her nice little bistro up on chardon and bishop . i ve been going there for years now and have even used her catering service for my work . the food met and exceeded my expectation for a small place like becky s to serve over people and different shifts . food at becky s ranges from pizza to pasta and gyros to meatball subs , and everything in between , literally . i personally love the spicy chicken pasta , her pizza s , the meatball sub is one of the best i ve had , and her italian wedding soup is to die for . i ve brought others there and they agree . . . . unless they were just making me feel better . bar is fully stocked and you have to try one of tony s martini s , fantastic i tell you . there is a nice wine list for you grape lovers out there . becky s occasionally has music throughout the week , sometimes w sat , th sat , just depends on the week i guess but the music is usually s s with the occasional s present . yes its a small place but it gets a rockin at night . my recommendation is to get there about pm , eat , drink like a fish , and stay for a couple sets . you might find it will be all you do that night . even better , becky participates in the www . restaurant . com promotion too . i m getting hungry just thinking of it . ok . . . . i am hoping that becky s bistro has finally made the changes it needs to become a staple in willoughby hills and in the east burbs of cleveland . becky s the owner little restaurant has been having an identity crisis the last couple years trying to figure out menu issues , who to cater to , live music options , and food quality chefs cooks but i think after my most recent visit i think its finally hitting its stride . starting last weekend and as advertized in the friday magazine in plain dealer , becky s is starting her sunday brunch for a reasonable bucks that includes one hell of a spread . we personally got the run down and say pictures from her first brunch weekend when we visited becky s yesterday . i have to say i was impressed . another high note is that becky s has expanded into the next available slip in her mini mall location . this means that the bar has been extended and seating is now away from the music so you re not completely overwhelmed by s s s tunes blasting in your ears , clouding any conversation you are trying to have . sometimes its fun , other times its just a bit pesky if you know what i mean . the new seating was pleasant enough that we brought our month old daughter in and she slept through it all ! ! let me end this update on the food . as my last updated stated , we were not very impressed with the overall effort the restaurant put in and only hoped that the next visit would be better . . . . . oh . . . and it was . we were delightfully impressed by the romaine salad with grilled salmon and caesar dressing , the stuffed peppers , and the italian wedding soup . although the soup was a little salty , it definitely tasted like the italian wedding soup that i fell in love with over years ago . . . . bravo . its not on menu so make sure to specifically ask for it . . . . i know , weird but that s becky ! now i ve tried the stuffed peppers a couple years ago and i have to tell you that the half order not only was that a lot of food but it was wonderfully plated and delicious , its not stuffed bells , more like banana peppers . salmon on the salad was cooked perfectly . it reminded me of a really good grilled romaine wedge that i had while years ago , although becky s romaine isn t grilled , its still crisp and tasty . glass of red was only . and beer was . , cheaper then places that offer happy hour wines for a glass . our tab before tip after beers and wine was less then . we had a great late night snack and just love the changes except the removal of the meatball sub . we can t wait to try out the brunch . expect a quick note about the brunch in the coming weeks . stopped in more recently and becky s must have changed their recipe for some of her staples . the italian wedding soup didn t have the savory finish and the meatballs lacked their usual flavor . the lobster bisque , although good , came out room temperature and needed to be microwaved . the veal marsala was really good , flavorful , and had a decent amount of meat . the chicken special was blah , needed a lot of lemon wedge and really should have come with a sauce . i mixed it with my marsala sauce which seemed to help . the tomato sauce that comes on top of the pasta side was bland . it really tasted like it was crushed tomatoes put in a blender with no seasoning . something changed because it was terrific last time i dined there . i was also hoping for some garlic bread but no go . one thing really stuck out though was the plating . although i consider becky s one of my favorite places to go in the area , something is really wrong with plating . for my dinner and side i received two huge dinner plates , this was true with the wife s food too . we ran out of room on our table and it was very difficult to eat . if i would have known , i would have had my marsala served over penne with the broccoli side in a bowl or small plate . we both left disappointed . now lets take a few things into consideration . it was new years eve and it was later in the night . the items we ordered were from a nye menu and maybe the daytime chef left for the night , who knows . this is the th time i ve eaten here in the past . years and the first time i have had a sub par experience . i am chalking this up as a bad night on becky s part , but for tab , i really can t afford to keep going to places where its a risk at getting good food . read my previous review for other dishes i have tried and get one of them , i will definitely retreat back to what i know for next time . star to star . i will modify again based on my next experience . i really enjoy becky and her nice little bistro up on chardon and bishop . i ve been going there for years now and have even used her catering service for my work . the food met and exceeded my expectation for a small place like becky s to serve over people and different shifts . food at becky s ranges from pizza to pasta and gyros to meatball subs , and everything in between , literally . i personally love the spicy chicken pasta , her pizza s , the meatball sub is one of the best i ve had , and her italian wedding soup is to die for . i ve brought others there and they agree . . . . unless they were just making me feel better . bar is fully stocked and you have to try one of tony s martini s , fantastic i tell you . there is a nice wine list for you grape lovers out there . becky s occasionally has music throughout the week , sometimes w sat , th sat , just depends on the week i guess but the music is usually s s with the occasional s present . yes its a small place but it gets a rockin at night . my recommendation is to get there about pm , eat , drink like a fish , and stay for a couple sets . you might find it will be all you do that night . even better , becky participates in the www . restaurant . com promotion too . i m getting hungry just thinking of it . ok . . . . i am hoping that becky s bistro has finally made the changes it needs to become a staple in willoughby hills and in the east burbs of cleveland . becky s the owner little restaurant has been having an identity crisis the last couple years trying to figure out menu issues , who to cater to , live music options , and food quality chefs cooks but i think after my most recent visit i think its finally hitting its stride . starting last weekend and as advertized in the friday magazine in plain dealer , becky s is starting her sunday brunch for a reasonable bucks that includes one hell of a spread . we personally got the run down and say pictures from her first brunch weekend when we visited becky s yesterday . i have to say i was impressed . another high note is that becky s has expanded into the next available slip in her mini mall location . this means that the bar has been extended and seating is now away from the music so you re not completely overwhelmed by s s s tunes blasting in your ears , clouding any conversation you are trying to have . sometimes its fun , other times its just a bit pesky if you know what i mean . the new seating was pleasant enough that we brought our month old daughter in and she slept through it all ! ! let me end this update on the food . as my last updated stated , we were not very impressed with the overall effort the restaurant put in and only hoped that the next visit would be better . . . . . oh . . . and it was . we were delightfully impressed by the romaine salad with grilled salmon and caesar dressing , the stuffed peppers , and the italian wedding soup . although the soup was a little salty , it definitely tasted like the italian wedding soup that i fell in love with over years ago . . . . bravo . its not on menu so make sure to specifically ask for it . . . . i know , weird but that s becky ! now i ve tried the stuffed peppers a couple years ago and i have to tell you that the half order not only was that a lot of food but it was wonderfully plated and delicious , its not stuffed bells , more like banana peppers . salmon on the salad was cooked perfectly . it reminded me of a really good grilled romaine wedge that i had while years ago , although becky s romaine isn t grilled , its still crisp and tasty . glass of red was only . and beer was . , cheaper then places that offer happy hour wines for a glass . our tab before tip after beers and wine was less then . we had a great late night snack and just love the changes except the removal of the meatball sub . we can t wait to try out the brunch . expect a quick note about the brunch in the coming weeks . <end>'],\n",

! ! like i was actually able to put both my hands around the bowl of the soup and it was room temperature ! very disappointing ! ! we told the server and all she just did was swap me another one that was coincidently coming out to the kitchen to another table . seems like she didn t care that the soup was cold ! ! as we were waiting for other food to come , we finished some of the side dishes and wanted refills , the server wasn t too friendly when we asked and told us you can only choose to refill . i ve never been to any other restaurant that limits how much you refill side dishes . apparently as i read reviews from fellow yelpers , they also give you a free pancake with your side dishes , which we never got !
